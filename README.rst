Just use the `interactive demo <http://jacquev6.github.io/DrawGrammar/>`_, load examples and play with the settings.

Hacking and command-line version
================================

DrawGrammar uses a library of mine, General, which is not distributed yet.
This means that you won't be able to build the project on your machine.
Please bear with me until I publish General or I decide to remove it from DrawGrammar's dependencies.
Or if you're in a hurry, feel free to contact me to get a development version of this library.
